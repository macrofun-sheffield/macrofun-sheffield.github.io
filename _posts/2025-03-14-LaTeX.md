Caleb Scutt gave us an excellent tutorial on what LaTeX is all about and how to use it. It's all in his excellent repo [here](https://github.com/calebowski/LaTeX-Macrofun/blob/main/) that you can run easily in [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (if you don't want to install it) or on your own machine (after [installing MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download)).
