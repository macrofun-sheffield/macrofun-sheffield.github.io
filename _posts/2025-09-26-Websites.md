## Online presence

Also useful for linking all the academic profile websites like ORCID, Google Scholar, Github, etc.
Can add links to the institutional website, social media accounts.

## A nicer version of your CV

Point of the webpage is to keep track of where you are and what you are doing (e.g. when you're moving around).
It can be use to advertise different things about you depending on career level. For example if you're late PhD/Postdoc, it allows you to showcase your work for future recruiters.
If you're a PI you can use it to advertise recruitment opportunities.

The classic information people put it:
 - a brief summary about yourself
 - a longer summary of your research (this often covers different aspects, i.e. different topics)
 - a list of your publications and/or your CV
 - a contact page
 - some bonus pages about other things you do around academia: outreach, natural history hobbies, etc. (often it's pictures for some reason

## Owning your profile (especially when changing jobs)

Personal webpages are important because you can control what you put on it. You can have a flexible format and add whatever you want. This is especially good when changing institutions, you can keep all your information and travel with it (and make it really nice!). On the other hand if you use a lab one or an institution one, you don't have total control on what's on it and you cannot move it around.

## Using it as a flexible repository

But mainly it can be used as a better more usable repository of all the things you've done in the past (as opposed to the CV that has less flexibilities).
For example, people put their teaching materials, tutorials, resources (sometimes random pdfs of papers not accessible otherwise), etc.
