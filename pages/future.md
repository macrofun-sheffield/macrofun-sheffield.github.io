## 11th of April: Geopolotics and ecology

 * at 14:00 - Room D216

Alain Danet is going to lead a discussion on the geopolitical aspect of addressing climate change and environmental issues. It will be based on the [recent work](https://www.chaireeconomieduclimat.org/en/viewpoints-en/book-club-en/the-chair-read-for-you-vers-lecologie-de-guerre-une-histoire-environnementale-de-la-paix-by-pierre-charbonnier/
) of Pierre Charbonnier. 
 -->

 <!-- Session on how to give talks! How to write them, how to prepare them, how to deliver them?
Imagining the best conference ever:
# What's the point of conferences?
 * networking (= meeting new people and old colleagues);
 * see the advances in the field (very good for catching up on old papers);
 * getting ideas (through chats and listening to talks);
 * for people near end of contracts: very good times for finding opportunities: advertise that you're looking and approach people that are hiring   
# Posters vs. talks?
# Small vs. big conferences?
# Problem with conferences:
 * Carbon foot print?
 * Price and time?
 * Visas for people from non-global north countries.
  -> conference organisation should facilitate for everyone.

We're having a summer break!
