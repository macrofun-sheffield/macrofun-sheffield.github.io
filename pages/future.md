<!-- ### 23rd of January: the best conference

 * at ??? room ???

Imagining the best conference ever:
# What's the point of conferences?
 * networking (= meeting new people and old colleagues);
 * see the advances in the field (very good for catching up on old papers);
 * getting ideas (through chats and listening to talks);
 * for people near end of contracts: very good times for finding opportunities: advertise that you're looking and approach people that are hiring   
# Posters vs. talks?
# Small vs. big conferences?
# Problem with conferences:
 * Carbon foot print?
 * Price and time?
 * Visas for people from non-global north countries.
  -> conference organisation should facilitate for everyone.
