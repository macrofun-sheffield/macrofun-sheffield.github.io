## What is macrofun?

We are a group of people meeting every two weeks in a nice and informal to chat about transferable skills and other things related to academia (**M**acroevolutionary **C**rew **R**adiating **O**utstanding **F**un and **U**nparalleled **N**onsense - Or **M**aking **ACRO**nyms is **F** **U**sless, **N**o need for one).

Everyone is more than welcome to join!

## Why is macrofun?

The main point is to have discussions about points that are not often told in academia.
Either because people think they're trivial (they're not) or because people haven't thought about it.
In practice we have mainly a mix between transferable skills (e.g. coding related) and how does academia work (e.g. how to leave academia?).
