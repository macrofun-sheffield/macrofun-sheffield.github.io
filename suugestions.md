 - How to get involved in teaching at different career stages
 - How to mentor/supervise? How to officialise helping people on your CV (being a co-supervisor)

 - Concise writing (e.g. in grants, papers, cover letters: get to the point)

January/February
 - Preparing for interviews. How to lead interviews (behind scenes)
    -> have in mind ACCE interviews #discussion

February/March:
 - Writing or/and applying for Marie Curies (by Jenifer: maybe for a session in February/March: start the grant first page how to?) #interview?

 March/April:

 - Babies in academia (Ask Jas, Jess and Chris?) #interview

Multiple sessions about reviewing papers:

 1. how to review a paper: do friendly reviews on someone's paper? Or a random preprint?
    A. some session on reviewing etiquette: how to write a review, what to review, anonymous or not? How to make it useful for everyone
    -> When scheduling 1A: try to scout for a paper for part 1B. Once session 1A is done, follow by 1B (people get to do some homework).
    B. exercise: let's review together a paper (someone's paper: friendly review style? - a random preprint?)
    -> When 1B is done, find time in the future (depending on AE jobs) to do part 2.
 2. Do that from the associate editors perspective: after all that, get a paper from EE and AE it all together. Also including discussion about the roles: Associate editor? Editor in chief? Executive editor? Handeling editor? Editing editor?
